	• Definition of FPGA:
		○ FPGA stands for Field Programmable Gate Array.
		○ These are circuits that can be reconfigured to emulate various other circuits.
		○ Allows users to convert an FPGA board into different functionalities based on their program.
		
	• Key Feature:
		○ Reconfigurability is a major advantage of FPGAs, enabling the same board to be used for different applications (e.g., smart traffic light system today, 4-bit adder tomorrow).
		
	• Comparison between CPU and FPGA:
		○ CPU:
			§ Executes a fixed and specific set of instructions sequentially.
			§ Hardware design is fixed.
			§ Designed for general-purpose tasks (e.g., microprocessors in computers).
			§ Produced at a mass scale, resulting in lower prices.
		○ FPGA:
			§ Has a series of reconfigurable logic blocks.
			§ Hardware components can be modified based on user needs.
			§ Used for designing specific circuits (e.g., license plate recognition systems).
			§ Less commonly used, thus more expensive, but offers high computational power.
			
	• Different from ASIC:
		○ ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) is designed for a single, specific application (e.g., chips for drones, Bitcoin miners).
		○ FPGAs, unlike ASICs, can be reprogrammed for different functions.
		
• Reconfigurability of FPGAs 
	• The ability to completely change FPGA functions is a significant advantage.
	• Example: An FPGA can function as a Bitcoin miner today and be reconfigured to control a drone tomorrow.
• FPGA Architecture
	• Basic Architecture:
		○ FPGAs consist of square blocks (programmable units) interconnected by lines.
		○ Input/output ports are situated on the sides.
	• Components:
		○ CLB (Configurable Logic Block):
			§ Contains lookup tables, latches, and flip-flops.
			§ Logic is computed within the CLB, while flip-flops and latches serve as memory.
			§ FPGAs can contain thousands or even millions of CLBs, depending on the complexity of the task.
• Example of CLB Functionality (7:08 - 7:44)
	• Example of an AND Gate:
		○ A CLB can be configured to perform a 2-input AND gate.
		○ Takes two inputs and outputs a 1 if both inputs are 1; otherwise, the output is 0.
• DSP Blocks in FPGA (7:45 - 8:27)
	• Purpose:
		○ DSP (Digital Signal Processing) blocks support arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
	• Arrangement:
		○ Similar to CLBs, DSP blocks are connected with interconnects and input-output ports.
• Memory Elements in FPGA (8:28 - 9:48)
	• RAM Elements:
		○ Flip-flops are used as memory elements in FPGAs.
		○ On-chip static RAM blocks can be of varying sizes, from kilobits to megabits.
		○ Memory size varies based on application needs, and low-end FPGAs typically have memory in a few KBs.
		
• Introduction to Basis III FPGA Board
	• Details of Basis III Board:
		○ Developed by Digilent in collaboration with Xilinx.
		○ Features include:
			§ 33,000+ logic cells in 5,200 slices.
			§ 1.8 megabits (1,800 kilobits) of RAM.
			§ 90 DSP slices.
			§ Internal clock supporting up to 450 MHz.
			§ 16 switches, 16 LEDs, 5 push buttons, and 4 seven-segment displays.
			§ VGA output port and P-mode connectors.
			§ Serial flash support, enabling programming via USB.
		○ This board is ideal for beginners for digital system design.
• Other Types of FPGAs 
	• Varieties of FPGAs:
		○ Some FPGAs can be integrated into CPUs, while others are used for storage or attached to PCI or memory cards.
		○ Intel Xeon processors incorporate Intel Aria FPGA system-on-chip.
		○ Networking-specific FPGAs also exist.
	• Learning Approach:
		○ Understanding one FPGA board (e.g., Zybo) can help grasp the basics of working with different types of FPGAs.
		○ Zybo is a simpler board, suitable for beginners.
