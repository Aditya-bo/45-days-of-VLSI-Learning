VLSI Overview:
	• Definition: VLSI stands for Very Large Scale Integration.
	• Integration: Refers to the integration of millions and billions of transistors on a single chip.
	• Transistor Technology:
		○ Early technologies: Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT), followed by Field-Effect Transistors (FET).
		○ Current standard: CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) transistors.
	• Advancement: The technology has progressed rapidly, from integrating thousands of transistors on a chip decades ago to now millions and billions.
	
Evolution of Integration:
	• SSI (Small Scale Integration): Less than 100 components on a single chip.
	• MSI (Medium Scale Integration): Integration of around 500 components.
	• LSI (Large Scale Integration): Integration of up to 300,000 components, made possible by Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools.
	• VLSI: Integration of millions and billions of components. Sometimes ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) is mentioned, but it is generally considered part of VLSI.
	
Technological Advancements:
	• Example of Hard Disks:
		○ The first hard disk by IBM had a capacity of 10 MB and was very bulky.
		○ Modern hard disks are compact (2.5 inches in width) with capacities in terabytes, demonstrating significant advancements in VLSI.
		
VLSI Design Flow:
	• Process: Involves designing, simulation, testing, and verification.
	• Steps:
		○ User Specifications: Define the system and constraints like chip area and power usage.
		○ Architecture Design: Different architectures are studied.
		○ Logic Design: Determine how to connect inputs and generate outputs.
		○ HDL Coding: Hardware Descriptive Language coding, focusing on Verilog.
		○ RTL Verification: Register Transfer Level verification ensures the correctness of the design.
		○ Fabrication: If the design meets specifications, it is sent for fabrication; otherwise, it is optimized and retested.
	
Moore’s Law:
	• Definition: Gordon Moore in 1965 predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would double every 14-18 months.
	• Implication: This predicted exponential growth in VLSI, with decreasing chip sizes and increasing circuit speeds.
	
Evolution of Microprocessors:
	• 1971: Introduction of the 4-bit microprocessor MP4004.
	• 1974: Launch of the 8-bit microprocessor 8008.
	• 1978: 16-bit microprocessor 8086, significantly expanding computing capabilities.
	• 1986: Introduction of 32-bit microprocessors like 80286 and the revolutionary Pentium processor in 1993, which brought computers into homes.
	• 2010: Intel's 64-bit microprocessors in the i3, i5, and i7 series, representing the modern, high-performing microprocessors.
