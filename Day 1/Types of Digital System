Introduction to Digital Systems
• There are two main categories of digital systems:
		1. Combinational Systems
		2. Sequential Systems
		
Overview of Digital Systems and Circuits 
	• Digital Circuits and Systems:
		○ Smaller assemblies are called circuits, and larger assemblies made from multiple circuits are called systems.
		○ Digital systems are categorized into:
			1. Combinational Circuits
			2. Sequential Circuits

  • Combinational Circuits:
		○ These circuits do not have memory and their outputs depend only on the current input values.
		○ Implementation requires only logic gates such as AND, OR, NAND, NOT, NOR, Exclusive OR, Exclusive NOR, etc.
		○ These circuits are primarily used for arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, and square root calculations.
		○ Block Diagram: Shows how multiple inputs can be logically connected using gates to generate one or more outputs.
		○ Examples:
			§ Arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, and finding the square root.
		○ Standard Combinational Blocks and Modules:
			§ Instead of writing code repeatedly for the same circuit, blocks and modules are created.

Sequential Circuits 
	• Sequential Circuits:
		○ These circuits have memory elements, allowing them to track previous output values.
		○ Used as the building blocks for memory elements like RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read Only Memory).
		○ Block Diagram: Includes a feedback loop where part of the output is fed back into the input.
		○ Example:
			§ Counting from 1 to 5: The output at each step depends on the previous output, demonstrating the need for memory.
		○ Standard Sequential Blocks and Modules:
			§ Latches: Basic elements that can hold one bit of data.
			§ Flip Flops: Similar to latches with slight differences.
			§ Registers: Combinations of multiple flip flops; when they shift data, they become shift registers.
			§ Other elements include counters, RAM (both dynamic and static), and finite state machines.
			
Comparison 
	• Comparison between Combinational and Sequential Circuits:
		○ Output Dependency:
			§ Combinational circuits depend only on current input values.
			§ Sequential circuits depend on both current and past input values.
		○ Speed:
			§ Combinational circuits are faster.
			§ Sequential circuits are slower due to memory elements.
		○ Triggering Signals:
			§ Combinational circuits do not require triggering signals.
			§ Sequential circuits require edge or level triggered signals, typically provided by a clock.
		○ Components:
			§ Combinational circuits are made purely of logic gates.
			§ Sequential circuits require flip flops.
		○ Applications:
			§ Combinational circuits are used for arithmetic and logical operations.
			§ Sequential circuits are used for data storage and memory-related applications.
