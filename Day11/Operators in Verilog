Categories of Operators in Verilog:

Arithmetic Operators:
Perform mathematical operations between one or more operands.
Examples:
Addition (+): y = a + b
Subtraction (-): y = a - b
Multiplication (*): y = a * b
Division (/): y = a / b
Modulo (%): Used to find the remainder.
Exponentiation (**): Performs power operations.

Relational Operators:
Compare two operands and are often used in conditional statements.
Examples:
Less than (<), Greater than (>), Less than or equal to (<=), Greater than or equal to (>=).
These operators help in creating conditions like if (a < 5) or if (5 >= b).

Equality Operators:
Used to check for equality between operands, considering Verilogâ€™s four logic values (0, 1, x, z).
Examples:
Strict equality (===): Compares both logic values and unknown values (x, z).
Equality (==): Compares only 0 and 1 values.
Inequality (!=): Compares 0 and 1 values.
Strict inequality (!==): Compares 0, 1, x, and z.

Logical Operators:
Perform logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT.
Examples:
Logical AND (&&), Logical OR (||), and Logical NOT (!).

Bitwise Operators:
Perform operations at the bit level, such as AND, OR, XOR, and XNOR.
Examples:
Bitwise AND (&), Bitwise OR (|), Bitwise XOR (^), and Bitwise XNOR (~^ or ^~).
These operators compute bitwise results and store them in a register.

Shift Operators:
Shift data bits left or right.
Examples:
Logical left shift (<<) and logical right shift (>>).
Arithmetic left shift (<<<) and arithmetic right shift (>>>).
For example, a << 2 shifts the bits of a by 2 to the left, and b >> 3 shifts the bits of b by 3 to the right.
