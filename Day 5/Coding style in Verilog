Overview of Coding Styles
	• Three levels of abstraction: behavioral, data flow, gate level.
	• Data flow and behavioral coding are often combined into a common style.
	• Thus, there are two main coding styles:
		○ Data flow/behavioral modeling
		○ Gate level modeling
		
Data Flow Modeling
	• Defines system functionality using functions without specifying gate-level structures.
	• Utilizes various operators acting on operands to produce the desired output.
	• Increasingly popular with advanced systems and EDA tools.
	• Mainly used for combinational circuits and arithmetic modules.
	
Examples of Data Flow Modeling: assign y1 = i1 & i2;
                                assign y1 = (i1 & i2) || i3;

Gate Level Modeling
	• Suitable for simple circuits with a few gates, optimized using Boolean expressions.
	• Uses logic gates (primitives): AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR, and pull gates.
	• Allows multiple input gates and multiple output gates (e.g., buffers, NOT gates).
	
Examples of Gate Level Modeling: and ( y1, x1, x2);   // y1 is assigned as and of x1 and x2
                                  or ( y1, x1, x2);   // y1 is assigned as and of x1 OR x2
