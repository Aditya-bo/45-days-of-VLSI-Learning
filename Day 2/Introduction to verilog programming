Introduction to Verilog Programming:

Understanding HDL (Hardware Descriptive Language):
	• Definition: HDL is used to describe the hardware of a digital system through text-based coding rather than schematic diagrams.
	• Functionality: HDLs help in designing hardware at different levels of abstraction, simulating the hardware, and verifying the design through simulation before fabrication.

Commonly Used HDLs:
	• Verilog:
		○ Widely used in the industry.
		○ Syntax is similar to C programming, making it easy to learn, especially for beginners.
		○ This training assumes no prior knowledge of Verilog.
	• VHDL:
		○ Stands for Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit HDL.
		○ More popular in academia.
		○ Codes are lengthier, with more programming constructs, allowing for high-level modeling.
		○ While both languages have their pros and cons, Verilog is chosen for this training due to its prevalence in the industry.

Levels of Abstraction in HDL:
	• Definition: The level of abstraction refers to the complexity of the program design, with higher levels being less complex.
	• Four Levels:
		1. Algorithmic or Behavioral Level:
			§ Describes the algorithm or behavior of the digital system without detailing the connections (e.g., describing a full adder by saying "add A and B").
		2. Data Flow Level:
			§ Uses Boolean expressions to relate outputs to inputs.
		3. Gate Level:
			§ Code is written using logic gates like AND, OR, XOR, etc.
		4. Switch Level:
			§ Involves programming using transistors (BJTs or CMOS). However, this level is not covered in this training as it is mainly for backend design.

Structure of a Verilog Program:
	• Design Block (Module):
		○ Contains the code that defines the inputs, outputs, and their relationships.
	• Testing Block (Stimulus):
		○ Defines how inputs change over time, the number of test cases, and the duration of each test.

Design Methodologies for Digital Systems:
	• Two Approaches:
		1. Top-Down Approach:
			§ Start with the main logic, divide the system into sub-modules, and further into simpler circuits.
		2. Bottom-Up Approach:
			§ Start with the simplest logic cells, connect them, and build up to implement the entire system.

Simulator Options for Verilog Programming:
	• Proprietary Simulators:
		○ Require a subscription. Examples include Active HDL, MPSim, Quartus (QSim), and Xilinx Simulator.
	• Open Source Simulators:
		○ Available for free. Examples include Cascade, TKgate, and Verywell.
	• Xilinx Simulator:
		○ The training program will use the Xilinx simulator, specifically the free Webpack edition, which offers enough features for beginners.
